**secureML Audit Framework: AI Security & Governance Toolkit**

**Overview**

This project delivers a cutting-edge, modular framework to assess, secure, and govern machine learning models — with a strong focus on regulated industries such as financial services. It simulates advanced adversarial attacks (e.g., prompt injection), classifies AI risk per regulations (like the EU AI Act), detects bias, and automates audit logging plus incident response. Designed for real-world AI governance challenges, secureML enables practitioners and compliance teams to build trustworthy, transparent, and fully auditable ML pipelines.

The framework leverages state-of-the-art Python libraries and emphasizes security, fairness, and compliance — making it an indispensable asset for any organization aiming to responsibly deploy AI in high-stakes environments.

**Key Features**

Adversarial Attack Simulations: Evaluate vulnerability of LLMs and ML models against prompt injections and other manipulations
Risk Classification & Bias Detection: Automated model risk scoring with demographic fairness analysis for sensitive attributes
Governance & Audit Logging: Generate detailed, auditable metadata and incident reports compatible with regulatory compliance
Incident Response Playbook: Structured, reproducible process to document, analyze, and remediate AI security incidents
Modular & Extensible: Easily integrates into existing ML workflows and adapts to diverse organizational policies

Installation & Setup
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/erenaktuerk/secureML-audit-framework.git
cd secureML-audit-framework

	2.	Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

For Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

	4.	Run notebooks in order or launch main.py to execute the complete governance and security pipeline.

**Governance Pipeline Highlights**
	•	Comprehensive risk and bias assessment aligned with EU AI Act and financial regulations
	•	Automated audit trail creation for model metadata, risk levels, bias metrics, and incidents
	•	Robust incident response playbook ensures traceable and auditable mitigation steps for AI security threats
	•	Supports fairness and compliance with demographic parity and other bias detection methods

**Why This Project Stands Out**
	•	Industry-Relevant: Specifically crafted for AI governance challenges in financial services and regulated sectors
	•	Security-First Approach: Incorporates real adversarial scenarios to proactively identify model vulnerabilities
	•	Regulatory Alignment: Implements controls and documentation to help meet emerging AI laws and standards
	•	Modularity & Transparency: Enables easy adoption, auditability, and extensibility within enterprise ML workflows

**Lessons Learned**
	•	AI governance requires more than performance metrics — transparency, traceability, and ethical risk management are key
	•	Attack simulation reveals often overlooked vulnerabilities that could undermine trust in AI systems
	•	Automating audit and incident logging reduces human error and strengthens compliance posture
